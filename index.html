        <h3 id="story">Story</h3>
        <p>Much of the history of the baguette is speculation however, some facts can be established. Long, stick-like breads in France became more popular during the 18th century, French bakers started using "gruau", a highly refined Hungarian high-milled flour in the early 19th century, Viennese steam oven baking was introduced to Paris in 1839 by August Zang, and the Austrian Adolf Ignaz Mautner von Markhof's compact yeast in 1867 at the Universal Exposition. 
        </p>
        <p>Finally, the word "baguette" appears, to define a particular type of bread, in a regulation of the department of the Seine in August 1920: "The baguette, having a minimum weight of 80 g [2 3⁄4 oz] and a maximum length of 40 cm [16 in], may not be sold for a price higher than 0.35 francs apiece" No one of these events constitutes "the invention of the baguette", but together they define the modern "baguette".
        </p>
        <blockquote>Poetry is an act of peace. Peace goes into the making of a poem as flouer goes into the making of bread. 
          <br>Pablo Neruda
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          In summary, "the bread which became known as the baguette first appeared in its most primitive form in the eighteenth century, then experienced a number of refinements and variations before being (officially) given that name in 1920.

        <h3 id="process">Process</h3>
        <p>To make the starter: Mix everything together to make a soft dough. Cover and let rest at room temperature for about 14 hours; overnight works well. The starter should have expanded and become bubbly.</p>
        <h4>1. Mixing</h4>
        <p>To make the dough: Mix and knead everything together — by hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a soft, somewhat smooth dough; it should be cohesive, but the surface may still be a bit rough. If you're using a stand mixer, knead for about 4 minutes on medium-low speed (speed 2 on a KitchenAid); the finished dough should stick a bit at the bottom of the bowl.</p>
        <div class="images mixing"></div>

        <h4>2. Folding</h4>
        <p>Be sure to let your dough sit for about 20-30 minutes between folds, to ensure the gluten structure has a chance to develop before being disturbed again.</p>
        <div class="images folding"></div>

        <h4>3. Proofing</h4>
        <p>Place the dough in a lightly greased medium-sized bowl, cover the bowl, and let the dough rest and rise for 45 minutes. Gently deflate the dough and fold its edges into the center, then turn it over in the bowl before letting it rise for an additional 45 minutes, until it's noticeably puffy.</p>
        <div class="images proofing"></div>

        <h4>4. Baking</h4>
        <p>Bake the baguettes — on the pan, or on a stone — for 24 to 28 minutes, or until they're a very deep golden brown. Remove them from the oven and cool them on a rack. Or, for the very crispiest baguettes, turn off the oven, crack it open about 2", and allow the baguettes to cool completely in the oven, until both baguettes and oven are at room temperature.</p>
